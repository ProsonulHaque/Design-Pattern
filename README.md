# The Design Pattern

Design pattern is a documented best practice of a solution that has been applied 
successfully to solve a problem that recurs a specific set of situations.
In a short we can say recuring solution to a common problem in a given context.
GOF devide design patterns in 3 types
i) Creational Design Pattern: The patterns which are responsible for creating objects. Ex: Factory, Builder, Singleton etc.
ii) Structural Design Pattern: The patterns which are responsible for assembles objects.
and classes to create better strucutre for efficiency and flexibilities.  Ex: Adapter, Bridge, Facade etc.
iii) Behaviour Design Pattern: The patters which are assign responsiblities between objects. Ex: State, 
ChainOfResponsibility, TemplateMethod etc.

Here I demonastrate few important design patterns that can be use in real life application/api development:

1. Strategy
2. Facade
3. Factory
4. Singleton
5. Specification
6. Adapter
7. Decorator
8. Proxy
9. Repository
10. Mediator
11. NullObject
12. ChainOfResponsibility
13. Builder
14. Template Method
15. State
16. Observer
