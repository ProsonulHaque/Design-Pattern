- Overview:
	
	- Behaviral Design Pattern.

	- Define structure, sequece of a algorithm/prcess/steps.

	- Child classes will be implement the steps without changing the structure.

	- Point to be noted that steps are fixed but implementation may vary.

	- Mostly use Framework development.

	- Very similar to factory method. The differce is factory method create object,
	  template method define behaviour.

- Implementation Procedure:
	
	- Define Steps in Base/Super class.

	- Implements steps in Sub/Child classes.

- Advantages:

	- More flexible to change logic without structural change.
