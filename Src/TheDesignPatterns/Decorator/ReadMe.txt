Overview:

- It is a structural design pattern.

- Wrapping to any class and extend or open to extend its functionality dynamically without change the
  original object.

- Use composition to work with.

- Very similar to adapter and Proxy design pattern. Adapter provide new interface,  
  Proxy provide same interface for exising object. Decorator provide 
  enhanced interface. 


Benifits:

- Allow additional functionallities dynamically to an existing object without altering main object.

- Wihout subclassing we can extend behaviour.

- Follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

- Combining several behaviours with wrapping an object into multiple operators.

- Possible to bind one object with the decorator and wrap their result with another decorator.

- Allow to follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
