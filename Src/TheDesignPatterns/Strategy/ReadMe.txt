Overview:

- It is a behavioral Design pattern. Invented by GOF.

- A set of policy/stratigy/algorithm defined into objects and those policis 
  are interchanged during runtime inside context object based on context values.

- This pattern is compatable with Open close principle (OCP) purpose is class is open for extension but close for modification

- This pattern uses composition instead of inheritence. Behaviours are defined in separate interfaces and classes. Behaviour can be 
  changed without breaking the classes that use it. Behaviour can be changed at runtime as wel as design time.
